sort1 uses: Bubble sort.

How do you know?: Although sort1 has similar run times to sort3
for random sets of numbers, sort1's run time for a huge set of
sorted numbers is significantly lesser than sort3's. Since Bubble
sort's big Omega is smaller than Selection sort's, having a
significantly smaller run time for ideal cases like sorted sets of
numbers suggests that sort1 is Bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort.

How do you know?: sort2's run time for a huge set of random numbers
is comparably lesser than that of sort1's and sort3's.

sort3 uses: Selection sort.
How do you know?: Although sort1 and sort3  has similar run times
for random sets of numbers, sort3's run time for a huge set of
sorted numbers is significant greater than sort1's. Since Selection
sort's big Omega is smaller than Bubble sort's, sort3 is likely
to be Selection sort.
