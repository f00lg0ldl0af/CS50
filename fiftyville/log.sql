Interviewee: Ruth
Sometime within ten minutes of the theft,
I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot
and drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery
parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the
parking lot in that time frame.

Interviewee: Eugene
I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.
Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery,
I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief
there withdrawing some money.

TODO: GET BANK ACCOUNT

Interviewee: Raymond
As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who
talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the
thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight
out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person
on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
